<p align="center"><font face="papyrus" color="black">On January 13, 2020, as a Diploma in Library Management student 
at UiTM Cawangan Kedah I began to join industry training at the Perpustakaan Tun 
Abdul Razak, UiTM Cawangan Kuala Pilah. During my six weeks of industry training, 
I learned a lot about library management that I couldn't get in class. I have learnt 
in each section of the library in library administration, acquisition of printed 
materials, cataloging and classification, procurement of serial issues, information 
and reference services, library management systems, customer and collection 
management, repository development, and record and archive management.</p>
<p align="center"><font face="papyrus" color="black">Almost every day there, before starting work, I would organize books on 
the shelves by subject. In addition, I was assigned to complete physical materials 
such as barcode paste, spine labels and QR codes. Next week, I was assigned to brief 
the interim students about Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC), Reference Management
 Software which is Endnote and Mendeley. Also, create informative banners and 
carnival posters using Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p align="center"><font face="papyrus" color="black">By participating in industry training, I am also exposed to 
the real world of work and gain more experience. In addition to learning about library management, 
I was also taught to be more disciplined in following the instructions and punctual.</p>
<p align="center"><font face="papyrus" color="black">Last but not least, I am very grateful to be given the opportunity to do
 industry training at Perpustakaan Tun Abdul Razak, UiTM Cawagan Negeri Sembilan.
 A big thanks for all the staff at the library for teaching me for six weeks. 
I am very happy to be surrounded by good and caring people.</p>
